# D3Project

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has historically always had a 18% out state and 82% in state student population spread. 
This is a website showing the potential tuition revenue differences if UNC were to adopt the percentage distrubition of students of other peer and local universities.

Peer universities in this context are defined as public universities with similar rankings nationwide. 
Local universities are defined as public universities in North Carolina. 
Potential tuition revenue gain or loss is defined in this sense:
		
Keep UNC's student body population the same and keep it's tuition rates the same. Simply change the percentages for student distribution.
